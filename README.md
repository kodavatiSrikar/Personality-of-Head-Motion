# Personality-of-Head-Motion

# Overview
This work presents a model that identifies a person's personality traits given Head Motion, and a large-scale standardized dataset of Head Motion in terms of Action Units, Head Rotation and Eye Gaze. The project employs an iterative training approach to train a Hybrid Attention model that predict personality traits based on the Head Motions.
