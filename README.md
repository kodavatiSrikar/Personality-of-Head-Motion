# Personality-of-Head-Motion

# Overview
This work presents a model that identifies a person's personality traits given Head Motion, and a large-scale standardized dataset of facial expressions in terms of Action Units. The project employs an iterative training approach to train two models (a Hybrid Attention model and a 1D-CNN model) that predict personality traits based on the Action Units.
